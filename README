Simple typeless binary tree written entirely in C.
Usage:
run make all to build the library
a pointer to an object must be passed to insert with the following properties:
	the first sizeof(int) bytes must be the index key (unique as possible)
	the second sizeof(int) bytes must be the size of the entire object
	the remainder can be data (or empty, if wished)
The library is very simple to use, just look at functions.h and it becomes clear
